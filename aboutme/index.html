<body> my name is Ben Robinson, I am from Alabama, this is my 5th semester and I just swapped to computer information technology,
    I am not totally sure what I want to do with it yet but we will figure it out. some things that I enjoy are like video games,
    working out, video games, hanging out with friends, and apparently sending in assignments late, haha. I hope I can get to know
    all of you throughout the semester!
