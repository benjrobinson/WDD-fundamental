            <p>       One of the main ways people can optimize their diets is by eating healthier in the gym,
                as you break down your muscles in the gym the way to build them back up is by putting 
                the correct nutrients back into your body, as you do that your body uses those proteins and
                other healthy nutritional values such as fibers, fats, carbohydrates to either give you energy or help
                your muscles grow, if you workout in the gym every day for 2 hours and then come back home and only eat
                icecream and other unhealthy snacks, you might see a little bit of progress depending on how fast your metabolism
                is working but it is overall going to make you unhealthy and hurt your results in the gym. the main things you want to
                make sure are in your diets are depending on what you would like to do, on the next page you will see different ways you
                can gain muscle and weight (bulking), or lose weight and gain muscle (cutting), those are the two most popular ways
                to gain and lose weight but there are so many other sub-categories for either one of those.</p>

            <h3>Nutriton</h3>
            <img class="nutrition-img" src="styles/images/nutrition label.jpg" alt="nutrition label">
            <p>A good way to know what you are putting in your body is to check the nutrition label to see how healthy or 
                how harmful a product or food is for you, you generally want more protein than carbohydrates for cutting and it 
                does not matter as much for bulking, avoiding sugars and harmful fats in a good rule of thumb.
